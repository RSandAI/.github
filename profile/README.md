# RSandAI: REMOTE SENSING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GROUP GITHUB PAGE

This github page contains the research conducted under supervision of Prof. Elif SERTEL at Istanbul Technical University. 

We  have been sharing repos of our ongoing activities that include our codes and papers on Geospatial Artificial Intelligence topic specifically on Remote Sensing Data and Historical Maps.

We have been collaborating with several researchers including Master and PhD students and Post-Doctoral fellows since 2016. 

Special thanks to Cengiz Avci, Samet Aksoy, Şule Nur Topgül, Burak Ekim and Dr. Tolga Bakirman for their active supports.

You can also reach us from "remotesensingandai@gmail.com" or directly e-mail to Prof. Sertel from "sertele@itu.edu.tr"
