# RSandAI: Remote Sensing and Artificial Intelligence Group GITHUB Page

This github page contains outputs of GeoAI research conducted under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Elif SERTEL at Istanbul Technical University. 

We  have been sharing repos of our ongoing activities that include our codes and papers on Geospatial Artificial Intelligence topic specifically on Remote Sensing Data and Historical Maps.

We have been collaborating with several researchers including Academics, Master/PhD students, and Post-Doctoral fellows since 2016. 

You can also reach us from "remotesensingandai@gmail.com" or directly e-mail to Prof. Sertel from "sertele@itu.edu.tr"
